3. How is the materiality assessment performed?
63. The ESRS do not mandate how the materiality assessment process shall be
designed or conducted by an undertaking. This is because no one process
would suit all types of economic activity, organisational structure, location of
operations or upstream and downstream value chains of all undertakings
applying the ESRS.

64. Therefore, an undertaking shall design a process that is fit for these purposes
based on its specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of the
depth of the assessment, as per the requirements of ESRS 1 Chapter 3 and of
the DRs regarding the materiality assessment and its outcome (see ESRS 2 IRO1, IRO-2 and SBM-3). In any case, an undertaking shall consider the full scope
of environmental, social and governance matters (i.e., sustainability matters)
as listed in ESRS 1 paragraph AR16 as well as any other matter that is material
from an entity-specific perspective.

65. The undertaking’s materiality assessment shall reflect both the impact and
financial materiality perspectives, as well as interconnections between the two,
but need not perform two separate and independent processes. The
identification of material impacts is generally a starting point since the financial
materiality assessment benefits from the outcome of the impact materiality
assessment (see ESRS 1 Chapter 3.3 Double materiality). The reason for this is
that material impacts trigger in most cases material risks and opportunities.
However, the undertaking shall also consider the possible matters that are
financially material only and may develop a step or a series of actions that are
specific to financial materiality. Finally, there may also be impacts deriving
from risks and opportunities and from the way that those risks and
opportunities are managed by the undertaking.
66. By way of illustration, a materiality assessment aligned with the ESRS could
follow the process outlined below, including four possible steps:
(a) Step A: Understanding the context;
(b) Step B: Identification of the actual and potential IROs related to
sustainability matters;
(c) Step C: Assessment and determination of the material IROs related to
sustainability matters; and
(d) Step D: Reporting. 
67. Chapter 5.3 FAQs on the materiality assessment process provides further
guidance, with specific FAQs on the process.
3.1 Step A: Understanding the context
68. In this step, the undertaking develops an overview of its activities and business
relationships, the context in which these take place and an understanding of
its key affected stakeholders. This overview provides key inputs to identify the
undertaking’s IROs.
Activities and business relationships
69. Activities and business relationships related to ESRS 2 SBM-1 are approached
in terms of:
(a) the analysis of the undertaking’s business plan, strategy, financial
statements and, when applicable, other information provided to
investors;
(b) the undertaking’s activities, products/services and the geographic
locations of these activities; and(c) the mapping of the undertaking’s business relationships and upstream
and/or downstream value chain, including type and nature of business
relationships.
Other contextual information
70. There are other factors that can help identify particular sources of IROs, such
as:
(a) the analysis of the undertaking’s relevant legal and regulatory
landscape; and
(b) the analysis of published documentation, such as media reports,
analysis of peers, existing sector-specific benchmarks and other
publications on general sustainability trends as well as scientific
articles.
Understanding of affected stakeholders
71. This is aimed at understanding which stakeholders are or are likely to be
affected by the undertaking’s own operations and upstream and downstream
value chain (see Chapter 3.5 Role and approach to stakeholders in the
materiality assessment process). It also includes their views and interests
(consistent with the disclosures per ESRS 2 SBM-2 Interests and views of
stakeholders). Based on this, the undertaking can identify its key affected
stakeholders. The following can be considered to aid such understanding:
(a) an analysis of the existing stakeholder engagement initiatives (such as
via communication, investor relations, business management, sales
and procurement teams); and
(b) a mapping of affected stakeholders across the undertaking’s activities
and business relationships. Separate groups of affected stakeholders
may be identified per activity, product or service and are to be
prioritised for a particular sustainability matter (this mapping may be
reviewed after Step B as needed).
72. Chapter 5.4 FAQ on stakeholder engagement provides further guidance on
the role of stakeholders. 

3.2 Step B: Identification of the actual and potential impacts,
risks and opportunities related to sustainability matters
73. In this step, the undertaking identifies the actual and potential impacts, risks
and opportunities (IROs) relating to environmental, social and governance
matters across its own operations and in its upstream and downstream value
chain. The outcome will be a ‘long’ list of impacts, risks and opportunities for
further assessment and analysis in subsequent steps (see section 3.3).
74. The undertaking should use the list of the sustainability matters in ESRS 1
paragraph AR16 to support this process and to ensure completeness. In some
cases, it may also use the actual disclosure requirements and related
Application Requirements in the topical standards; for example, the ESRS S1-
10 metric on adequate wages and its accompanying calculation methodology in ESRS S1 paragraph AR73 may help to assess whether the sub-subtopic
‘adequate wages’ is material. It is equally important for the undertaking to
consider entity-specific sustainability matters not covered in that list, if any.
Currently, until the sector standards are issued, sector sustainability matters
have to be identified and assessed as entity-specific matters. The available
best practices, frameworks and/or other reporting standards, such as the IFRS
industry-based guidance and GRI Sector Standards (ESRS 1 paragraph
131(b)), are possible resources to be used for the identification of entityspecific matters, especially whilst the sector-specific standards are not issued.
75. [Draft] EFRAG IG 3 – List of ESRS Datapoints released by EFRAG is not a
checklist to identify material matters or IROs with, as it serves a different
purpose. However, it can provide a useful inventory of the range of the
sustainability matters covered by the ESRS topical standards at a more
granular level (for example, metrics) than ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16.
76. Ultimately, for each identified material IRO that is reported, the undertaking
shall disclose whether it relates to either own operations and/or upstream or
downstream value chain as well as the relevant time horizon for potential
impacts and risks and opportunities, as per ESRS 1 Chapter 6.4 Definition of
short-, medium- and long-term for reporting purposes.
Approaches
77. The process of identification of the potential matters may start with the
screening of the list of matters summarised in ESRS 1 paragraph AR 16 and
then be complemented with additional entity-specific matters. These may
follow from either internal processes (e.g., due diligence, risk management or
grievance mechanisms) or external sources, such as those described in
paragraph 69 above and stakeholder engagement.
78. The undertaking may also develop a ‘long’ list of impacts, risks and
opportunities relevant to its business model and upstream/downstream value
chain and aggregate them following the structure provided in ESRS 1
paragraph AR 16. The approach detailed in paragraph 75 above could be
effective for undertakings new to preparing the sustainability statement.
Alternatively, an undertaking could start from the matters as informed by
existing processes (e.g., GRI reporting or internal processes such as due
diligence and risk management). Then, the undertaking could compare the
matters identified with the list in ESRS 1 AR 16 for completeness. The two
approaches may be combined.
79. Regardless of the approach chosen to identify material sustainability matters,
the purpose is to connect them to the corresponding IROs.
80. The undertaking may aggregate or disaggregate the IROs at the most
appropriate level according to its facts and circumstances. It should relate the
names it uses (or used before ESRS implementation) for sustainability matters
when these differ from the list in ESRS 1 AR 16.
81. Chapter 5.5 FAQ on aggregation/disaggregation provides further guidance
on aggregation/disaggregation.
3.3 Step C: Assessment and determination of material IROs
related to sustainability matters
82. In this step, the undertaking applies criteria for assessing impact and financial
materiality in order to determine the material actual and potential impacts and
the material risks and opportunities. This then forms the basis for determining
material information based on the ESRS topical disclosure requirements.
83. In ESRS 1 and ESRS 2, emphasis is being placed on setting appropriate
qualitative or quantitative thresholds to assess the materiality of IROs and
related disclosures. In particular, ESRS 2 paragraphs 53 and 59 require
disclosing how these thresholds have been set or applied.
3.3.1 Impact materiality assessment
84. ESRS 1 Chapter 3.4 requires that undertakings apply objective criteria, using
appropriate quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds to assess the materiality
of actual and potential impacts. This is based on severity and, for potential
impacts, also likelihood (see Chapter 3.6 Deep dive into impact materiality –
Setting thresholds).
85. Therefore, the undertaking has to apply the criteria for severity to the list of
impacts defined in step B above. The criteria are scale, scope and irremediable
character of the impact for actual negative impacts. For potential negative
impacts, the undertaking estimates also the likelihood of the impact occurring
and maps it onto the relevant time horizon. For actual positive impacts, the
criteria are scale and scope, and for potential positive impacts, the
undertaking shall also estimate the likelihood of occurrence and map it onto
the relevant time horizon.
86. Depending on the kind of impact, it may not always be necessary to assess in
depth each of the criteria of severity, based on the undertaking’s specific facts
and circumstances, to determine whether the impact is material or not. For
example, when there is an established scientific consensus about the severity
of a particular kind of global or localised environmental impact, the
undertaking can conclude that it is indeed material without having conducted
an in-depth analysis of its scale, scope and irremediability. Therefore, the
undertaking shall exercise judgement, informed by the available evidence, to
determine what the appropriate level of the assessment of the severity criteria
is.
87. The purpose of engagement with key affected stakeholders (including
workers and their representatives) is to help the undertaking understand how
they may be impacted, and therefore, it may help the undertaking assess the
severity and likelihood of impacts4
. Internal engagement with the
undertaking’s business functions and employees on the one hand and external
engagement with users of sustainability reporting and other experts on the other may also help to assess, validate and ensure the completeness of the
outcome of the materiality assessment (see ESRS 1 paragraph AR8).
88. Chapter 3.5 Role and approach to stakeholders in the materiality assessment
process and Chapter 3.6 Deep dive into impact materiality – Setting thresholds
provide detailed guidance on the application of impact materiality criteria and
thresholds. The responses to the FAQs on impact materiality in Chapter 5.1
provide further guidance on this matter. See also Chapter 4.3 Leveraging
international instruments of due diligence.
3.3.2 Financial materiality assessment
89. Material risks and opportunities for the undertaking generally derive from
impacts, dependencies or other factors, such as exposure to climate hazards
or changes in regulation that address systemic risks. To assess their materiality,
appropriate quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds based upon financial
effects in terms of performance, financial position, cash flows and access to
and cost of capital are used.
90. Sustainability risks and opportunities are assessed based on their likelihood of
occurrence and the potential magnitude of their financial effects in the short-,
medium- and long-term. Therefore, the undertaking is required to go through
the list of potential material risks and opportunities in step B above and apply
a set of objective thresholds for likelihood and magnitude as well as consider
the nature of the effects of the identified risks and opportunities.
91. As most impacts give rise to financial risks and opportunities, the undertaking
generally will assess whether material financial effects derive from the
identified impacts (including the outcome of step B).
92. When applicable, the undertaking may compare the material risks and
opportunities per the list prepared in step B to the ones used in its risk
management process (for example, ERM5 processes). However, this is only
when the latter also covers sustainability risks. In such a case, the likelihood of
the risks and opportunities, or their related financial effects, could be
estimated accordingly.
93. It may be appropriate to engage with the undertaking’s business functions as
well as with investors of the undertaking and other financial counterparties
(e.g., banks) to assess, validate and ensure the completeness of the list of
material risks and opportunities.
94. Once a matter has been assessed to be material from a financial perspective,
the undertaking determines the information to be reported based on its
materiality (see Chapter 2.3 Criteria to determine the materiality of
information). Information is considered financially material if omitting,
misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to
influence decisions that primary users of general-purpose financial reports
take on the basis of the undertaking’s sustainability statement relating to
providing resources to the undertaking. 
95. While the terms ‘risks’ and ‘opportunities’ are combined in the ESRS,
depending on the specific circumstances there are matters that trigger
exposure to risks only, others that trigger exposure to opportunities only and
others that trigger exposure to both.
96. Responses to FAQs on financial materiality in Chapter 5.2 and Chapter 3.7
Deep dive on financial materiality – Setting thresholds provide further guidance
on financial materiality.
3.3.3 Consolidating impact and financial materiality outcomes, including their
interaction
97. This step consolidates the results of the previous steps and obtains the list of
material IROs, which forms the basis for the preparation of the sustainability
statement. Analysis performed at material topic/subtopic or sub-subtopic level
is to be converted to IROs if this has not been done yet.
98. Once the undertaking has assessed individual IROs based on appropriate
thresholds and methodologies, it may aggregate the resulting IROs for
reporting purposes (refer to ESRS 1 paragraph 56). Those in charge of this
activity may also validate the aggregated double materiality results with
management to assess and validate the completeness of the list of material
IROs.
3.4 Step D: Reporting
99. Following the materiality assessment process, the undertaking shall report on
the assessment process and its outcome based on:
(a) ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess
material impacts, risks and opportunities;
(b) ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their
interaction with strategy and business model; and
(c) ESRS 2 IRO-2 Disclosure requirements in ESRS covered by the
undertaking’s sustainability statement. The undertaking shall also
disclose how it has determined the material information to be
disclosed, including thresholds and criteria used to assess such
information (ESRS 2 paragraph 59).
100. In addition, ESRS 2 GOV-2 Information provided to and sustainability matters
addressed by the undertaking’s administrative, management and supervisory
(AMB) bodies includes datapoints regarding how the AMB bodies are
informed about the material impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2
paragraph 26(a) considers the IROs when overseeing the undertaking’s
strategy and risk management process and how these material IROs have
been addressed during the period. Chapter 5.6 FAQ on reporting provides
further guidance on reporting.
