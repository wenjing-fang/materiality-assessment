3. How is the materiality assessment performed?
63. The ESRS do not mandate how the materiality assessment process shall be
designed or conducted by an undertaking. This is because no one process
would suit all types of economic activity, organisational structure, location of
operations or upstream and downstream value chains of all undertakings
applying the ESRS.

64. Therefore, an undertaking shall design a process that is fit for these purposes
based on its specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of the
depth of the assessment, as per the requirements of ESRS 1 Chapter 3 and of
the DRs regarding the materiality assessment and its outcome (see ESRS 2 IRO1, IRO-2 and SBM-3). In any case, an undertaking shall consider the full scope
of environmental, social and governance matters (i.e., sustainability matters)
as listed in ESRS 1 paragraph AR16 as well as any other matter that is material
from an entity-specific perspective.

65. The undertaking’s materiality assessment shall reflect both the impact and
financial materiality perspectives, as well as interconnections between the two,
but need not perform two separate and independent processes. The
identification of material impacts is generally a starting point since the financial
materiality assessment benefits from the outcome of the impact materiality
assessment (see ESRS 1 Chapter 3.3 Double materiality). The reason for this is
that material impacts trigger in most cases material risks and opportunities.
However, the undertaking shall also consider the possible matters that are
financially material only and may develop a step or a series of actions that are
specific to financial materiality. Finally, there may also be impacts deriving
from risks and opportunities and from the way that those risks and
opportunities are managed by the undertaking.
66. By way of illustration, a materiality assessment aligned with the ESRS could
follow the process outlined below, including four possible steps:
(a) Step A: Understanding the context;
(b) Step B: Identification of the actual and potential IROs related to
sustainability matters;
(c) Step C: Assessment and determination of the material IROs related to
sustainability matters; and
(d) Step D: Reporting. 
67. Chapter 5.3 FAQs on the materiality assessment process provides further
guidance, with specific FAQs on the process.
3.1 Step A: Understanding the context
68. In this step, the undertaking develops an overview of its activities and business
relationships, the context in which these take place and an understanding of
its key affected stakeholders. This overview provides key inputs to identify the
undertaking’s IROs.
Activities and business relationships
69. Activities and business relationships related to ESRS 2 SBM-1 are approached
in terms of:
(a) the analysis of the undertaking’s business plan, strategy, financial
statements and, when applicable, other information provided to
investors;
(b) the undertaking’s activities, products/services and the geographic
locations of these activities; and(c) the mapping of the undertaking’s business relationships and upstream
and/or downstream value chain, including type and nature of business
relationships.
Other contextual information
70. There are other factors that can help identify particular sources of IROs, such
as:
(a) the analysis of the undertaking’s relevant legal and regulatory
landscape; and
(b) the analysis of published documentation, such as media reports,
analysis of peers, existing sector-specific benchmarks and other
publications on general sustainability trends as well as scientific
articles.
Understanding of affected stakeholders
71. This is aimed at understanding which stakeholders are or are likely to be
affected by the undertaking’s own operations and upstream and downstream
value chain (see Chapter 3.5 Role and approach to stakeholders in the
materiality assessment process). It also includes their views and interests
(consistent with the disclosures per ESRS 2 SBM-2 Interests and views of
stakeholders). Based on this, the undertaking can identify its key affected
stakeholders. The following can be considered to aid such understanding:
(a) an analysis of the existing stakeholder engagement initiatives (such as
via communication, investor relations, business management, sales
and procurement teams); and
(b) a mapping of affected stakeholders across the undertaking’s activities
and business relationships. Separate groups of affected stakeholders
may be identified per activity, product or service and are to be
prioritised for a particular sustainability matter (this mapping may be
reviewed after Step B as needed).
72. Chapter 5.4 FAQ on stakeholder engagement provides further guidance on
the role of stakeholders. 

3.2 Step B: Identification of the actual and potential impacts,
risks and opportunities related to sustainability matters
73. In this step, the undertaking identifies the actual and potential impacts, risks
and opportunities (IROs) relating to environmental, social and governance
matters across its own operations and in its upstream and downstream value
chain. The outcome will be a ‘long’ list of impacts, risks and opportunities for
further assessment and analysis in subsequent steps (see section 3.3).
74. The undertaking should use the list of the sustainability matters in ESRS 1
paragraph AR16 to support this process and to ensure completeness. In some
cases, it may also use the actual disclosure requirements and related
Application Requirements in the topical standards; for example, the ESRS S1-
10 metric on adequate wages and its accompanying calculation methodology
